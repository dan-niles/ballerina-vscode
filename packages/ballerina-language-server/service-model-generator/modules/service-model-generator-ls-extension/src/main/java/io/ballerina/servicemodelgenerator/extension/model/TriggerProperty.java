/**
 * A trigger picker entry, loaded once (as a flat map) from {@code trigger_properties.json}.
 *
 * <p>{@code version}/{@code kind} are optional, populated only for a schema-driven trigger
 * (transcribed from its {@code trigger-model.json}'s own top-level fields at onboarding time). When
 * present, {@link ServiceModelGeneratorService} builds the trigger's {@link TriggerBasicInfo} directly
 * from these scalars (deriving the icon URL from {@code orgName}/{@code packageName}/{@code version}),
 * without parsing/caching the connector's full {@code TriggerUISchemaModel} just to populate the picker
 * list. A legacy trigger (e.g. HTTP, which has no schema-driven model at all) simply omits them,
 * falling back to the sqlite index derived from {@code service_artifacts.json}.
 *
 * @param name        the trigger's display name
 * @param orgName     the organization that owns the trigger's package
 * @param packageName the name of the package that provides the trigger
 * @param keywords    keywords used to search for the trigger in the picker
 * @param triggerName the trigger's unique identifier
 * @param version     the schema-driven trigger's model version, if any
 * @param kind        the schema-driven trigger's legacy kind, if any
 * @param triggerKind the canonical integration kind in newer metadata, if any
 * @param minSupportedVersion the lowest published version of this connector that ships its own
 *                            {@code metadata/trigger-metadata.json}/{@code trigger-ui-metadata.json}
 *                            (schema-driven trigger data moved from the LS jar into the connector
 *                            package itself). {@code null} for a trigger that either never needed this
 *                            (still hardcoded, e.g. http/graphql/tcp/ai) or has no published fix yet.
 *                            Deliberately a distinct field from {@code version} above, which records a
 *                            different, unrelated scalar (the model version at onboarding time) --
 *                            overloading it would silently change icon-URL derivation and the picker
 *                            list that already consume it.
