 * <p>This is a pure function of {@code (counts, window)} with no storage behind it, which is what lets a stateless
 * request page consistently: a page is the difference between the quotas at {@code offset} and at
 * {@code offset + limit}, and because quotas only grow as the window grows, consecutive pages tile without
 * duplicating or dropping rows.</p>
 *
 * <p>It lives outside {@link SearchDatabaseManager} because the sources being shared aren't necessarily all in the
 * index - type search allocates the same window across indexed modules and modules it has to compile on demand, and
 * both pools have to be measured against one another for either to get a fair share of the page.</p>
