 * Keeping a live workspace edit out of the user's tab bar.
 *
 * The agent writes `.bal` files through `workspace.applyEdit`, which is what keeps open editors,
 * the diagrams and the Language Server's `file://` view in step: the LS ignores disk-watcher events
 * for files the client already syncs, so a plain disk write would silently desync any file the
 * editor holds. The cost is that VS Code materialises a dirty document for every file the edit
 * touches and, unless it is saved within ~800 ms, opens a tab for it — so a generation writing
 * twenty files buried the editor in twenty tabs.
