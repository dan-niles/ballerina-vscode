Given the user's last message and the Copilot's response, propose 2-3 short, specific follow-up actions the user is most likely to want next. Each is shown as a clickable chip; clicking one sends its prompt to the Copilot as the user's next message.

Prefer these high-value actions when one fits what just happened, and phrase it for the current context:
${anchorGuidance}

If none fit, suggest a next step that clearly follows from the last exchange.`;

const ABORTED_FRAMING = `The Copilot builds integrations for the user. The user stopped it part-way, so the response below is cut short and the work is unfinished. Propose up to 2 short, specific ways the user might take the work in a DIFFERENT direction from where it stopped. Each is shown as a clickable chip; clicking one sends its prompt to the Copilot as the user's next message.

A separate "Continue" action is already offered to the user, so never suggest continuing, resuming, finishing, or completing the interrupted work — that is covered. People usually stop the Copilot because it was heading somewhere they did not want, so suggest plausible course corrections based on what it had started doing.`;

const ERROR_FRAMING = `The Copilot builds integrations for the user. This turn FAILED part-way, so the work is unfinished and whatever it was doing did not complete. The failure reason is given below. Propose up to 2 short, specific things the user can do about it.

Base the suggestions on the failure: if it looks like something the user can resolve or work around, suggest that; if the work was simply interrupted, suggest getting it finished. Never pretend the work succeeded, and never ask the user to debug the product itself.`;

const SHARED_RULES = `Scope — only suggest things the Copilot can actually do: build, change, explain, run, or test the user's integration, or connect it to other systems or services. Never suggest anything else, because it will be refused — in particular, no deploying to a container or cloud platform, and no infrastructure, CI/CD, or cloud-provider setup.

Audience — the user builds integrations in a friendly, low-code product and may not be a programmer. Write every label and prompt in plain, outcome-focused language: say what the user gets, not how it is built. Never expose implementation details — no programming-language or Ballerina specifics, no command-line commands, no code, annotation, or configuration syntax, no file, module, or library names, and no technical keywords or type names.

Output:
- Each suggestion has a "label" (imperative chip text, max ~4 words, e.g. "Add tests") and a "prompt" (a natural first-person message the user would send, e.g. "Add tests for the order service").
- The "prompt" is spoken by the user, so it is always an instruction and never a question. Never ask the user anything in it, and never carry over a question the Copilot asked.
- Base every suggestion on what actually happened in this exchange — be specific, never generic filler.
- Earlier turns, when provided, are background only: use them to understand what has already been built and to avoid repeating it. Suggest next steps for the latest exchange, not for the earlier ones.
- No duplicates; each must offer a distinct next step.
- Only include actions that genuinely make sense; one or two strong suggestions beat three padded ones.`;

- Never suggest something the Copilot already did in its response.`;
