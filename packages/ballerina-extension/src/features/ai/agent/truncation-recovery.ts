Your previous response was cut off because it reached the maximum output length for a single response. The tool call you were writing when that happened was never executed, so the change it carried did NOT reach the project. Tool calls you made earlier in this turn did run, and their edits are already saved to disk.

Before continuing:
1. Re-check the files you already changed in this turn and the current state of the project. Because that last change is missing, the code may be inconsistent, half-updated, or no longer compile.
2. Then finish the remaining work.

Make the remaining changes as several small edits instead of one large one — prefer a ${batchEditTool} with a few focused hunks, or several separate ${singleEditTool} calls, over rewriting a whole file in one call. Rewriting a large file in a single call will hit the same limit again.

Do not start the task over, and do not repeat edits that already succeeded — continue from where you stopped. You do not need to explain this message to the user, though you may briefly mention that you are completing the change in smaller steps.
